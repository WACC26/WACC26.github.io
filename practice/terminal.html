	<p> I will put my text in here. It will have how to make a minimal HTML page. </p>

	<p> A minimal HTML page is the base for all HTML pages. We use them for several things.  </p>

	<ul>
		<li> We use them to make our home pages. </li>
		<li> We use them for classwork, like this! </li>
		<li> We also use them for general pages, such as putting text on a screen. </li> 
	<ul> 

<p> Here is what a minimal HTML page looks like.  </p>

<title> Title text goes here </title>

<body>
<p> Text goes here! <p>
